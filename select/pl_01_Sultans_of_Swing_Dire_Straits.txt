You get a shiver in the dark
It's been raining in the park
but meantime
South of the river you stop and
you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double
four time
You feel all right when you hear
that music ring
You step inside but you don't
see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to
hear the jazz go down
Too much competition too many
other places
But not too many horns can make
that sound
Way on downsouth way on
downsouth London Town
You check out Guitar George
He knows all the chords, mind
he's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it
cry or sing
And an old guitar is all
he can afford
When he gets up under the lights
to play his thing
And Harry doesn't mind if he
doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job he's
doing alright
He can play honky tonk
just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans, with the
Sultans of swing
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around
in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best
brown baggies
And their platform soles, they
don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call
rock and roll
And the Sultans played Creole
And then the man he steps right
up to the microphone
And says at last just as the
time bell rings
goodnight now it's
time to go home
And he makes it fast with one
more thing
We are the Sultans
We are the Sultans of swing

[00:12.68] You get a shiver in the dark, it's raining in the park, but meantime
[00:19.72] South of the river, you stop and you hold everything
[00:26.52] A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
[00:32.53] You feel alright when you hear that music ring
[00:55.53] 
[00:41.48] Well, now you step inside, but you don't see too many faces
[00:49.03] Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
[01:14.03] 
[00:55.90] Competition in other places
[01:02.42] Ah, but the horns, they blowing that sound
[01:23.42] 
[01:08.94] Way on down south
[01:12.38] Way on down south, London town
[01:27.38] 
[01:26.67] You check out Guitar George, he knows all the chords
[01:33.95] Mind, he's strictly rhythm, he doesn't want to make it cry or sing
[01:41.29] Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
[01:47.23] When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
[02:12.23] 
[01:57.07] And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
[02:03.46] He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
[02:24.46] 
[02:10.35] He can play the honky-tonk like anything
[02:16.63] Saving it up for Friday night
[02:31.13] 
[02:23.55] With the Sultans
[02:26.95] With the Sultans of Swing
[02:39.45] 
[02:42.30] And a crowd of young boys, they're fooling around in the corner
[03:13.80] 
[02:48.86] Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
[02:55.67] They don't give a damn about any trumpet-playing band
[03:02.21] It ain't what they call rock and roll
[03:20.71] 
[03:09.18] And the Sultans
[03:11.95] Yeah, the Sultans, they played creole
[03:18.61] Creole
[03:21.61] 
[04:13.83] And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
[04:40.33] 
[04:21.81] And says at last, just as the time bell rings
[04:44.31] 
[04:28.38] "Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
[04:34.39] Then he makes it fast with one more thing
[04:54.89] 
[04:41.39] "We are the Sultans
[04:44.40] We are the Sultans of Swing"
